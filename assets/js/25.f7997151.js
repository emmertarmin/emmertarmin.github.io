Dad is generally balancing between fascination and skepticism, and this was a perfect occasion for us to ask every conceivable question we had before. Basically the farmer told us it's an investment which he calculated will pay off in 12 years, after which he expects making some profits. He generates more electricity than he needs, and he gets twice the money for each kWh of energy sold than what he pays for each consumed. I thought then that this is a no-brainer, but I've heard many stories since where people decided against investing in solar energy, simply because they have better opportunities to invest their money. And it's true, a 12 year investment isn't the best in the world, especially when solar panels haven't even proven a 12 year life-cycle in real life conditions yet.")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("But of course that's not how dad works.
