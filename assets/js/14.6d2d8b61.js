Not knowing much about the topic, I also feared it would be hard for me to experiment with all the variables, like bed temperature, extrusion temperature, etc. But I also couldn't justify spending close to $1000 dollars for a 3D printer that I can just use for free at the maker-space. So when I came across the MPSMV2 on Conrad, I basically impulse-bought it. I don't usually buy stuff on the first day of discovery, but after seeing that the MonoPrice model has a heated bed and is compatible with CURA (the slicer program for the Ultimaker printers), I was convinced it's good enough for experimentation. €180 in my view is cheap enough to warrant not-perfect printing quality for the sake of experimentation.
